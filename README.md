# 🎉 Welcome to Regressionify! 🎉  
_Where Numbers Meet Nerdy Magic._

Regressionify is the perfect blend of statistics, full-stack sorcery, and sheer nerdy enthusiasm! Got an Excel file filled with mysterious numbers? Upload it, and let Regressionify _regressionify_ the heck out of it. This is not just an app—it’s a final project for a statistics subject that doubles as a full-stack development adventure. 🚀

---

## 🧐 What is Regressionify?  
Regressionify is a web app built with **React Vite** on the frontend and **Flask Python** on the backend. It takes your Excel file, gives it a data spa day, and spits out meaningful regression analysis results. We’re talking serious number crunching, all served with a side of geeky charm.

## 💡 Why Regressionify?  
Because:  
- _"Why not?"_ didn’t sound professional enough for a statistics project.  
- Full-stack development is cool, and statistics deserved some pizzazz.  
- Your Excel files deserve better than sitting idle on your desktop.  

---

## 📋 Features
✨ **Sleek Frontend**: Built with React Vite for a snappy, modern interface.  
🧠 **Smart Backend**: Powered by Flask Python, where the magic happens.  
📂 **Excel File Upload**: Drop your `.xlsx` files in, and let the app do the work.  
⚡ **Instant Results**: Get regression insights quicker than you can say "linear correlation coefficient."

## 🔧 How to Make the Magic Happen

### Prerequisites
- Node.js  
- Python 3.x  
- A love for numbers (optional, but it helps).  

### Backend Setup (Flask)  
1. Clone this treasure trove:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/potakaaa/regressionify.git
   cd regressionify/backend
   ```  
2. Create a virtual environment and channel your inner wizard:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```  
3. Install the dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Start the Flask server:  
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```  

### Frontend Setup (React Vite)  
1. Head to the frontend folder:
